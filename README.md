# Login Page with Animations

This project is a web application that fulfills the requirements specified in the tech task. It creates a login page with smooth animations using HTML5, CSS3, and a touch of JavaScript to enhance the user experience. The animations closely follow the design specified in the provided video.

## Features
### Animated Login Page: 
The login page is designed with smooth animations, replicating the ones shown in the video. The animations are created using HTML5 and CSS3 tools, providing an engaging user interface.

### Dynamic Background Images: 
The page displays a series of background images. Initially, a random image is chosen, and every 10 seconds, the background image changes smoothly. After 1 minute, the rotation of the images stops. Even upon reloading the page, the first image is set to the one where the rotation stopped before the reload, ensuring consistency in user experience.


## Technologies Used
**HTML5**: Used to structure the content of the login page.

**SCSS**: Utilized for styling the page elements and creating animations.

**JavaScript**: Implemented to smoothly load background images and control the rotation logic.

## Deployment
The finished login page has been deployed to Netlify, a free hosting service, to ensure accessibility and seamless user interaction. You can access the [live demo here](https://qcrm-login-page.netlify.app/).
